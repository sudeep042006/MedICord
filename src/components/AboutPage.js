              <h2>Who We Are</h2>
              <p>
                At MediCord, we are a passionate team of healthcare innovators and blockchain technologists on a mission to break barriers in global healthcare. We aim to redefine how medical records are shared and accessed across borders, ensuring security, privacy, and seamless access for everyone, anywhere.

              <p>
                MediCord provides a secure, decentralized platform for managing and sharing Electronic Health Records (EHR) across countries. By leveraging cutting-edge blockchain technologies like Ethereum, Hyperledger, and IPFS, we ensure that medical data is accessible, interoperable, and protected‚Äîno matter where life takes you.

              <h3>For Doctors</h3>
              <p>
                Doctors can securely access authorized patient records, view medical histories, and contribute to treatment plans, even for patients traveling or living abroad.

              <h3>For Patients</h3>
              <p>
                Patients remain in full control of their medical data. They can view their health records, upload reports, and easily manage who can access their sensitive information‚Äîensuring privacy and consent are never compromised.
              </p>

              <h3>For Diagnostic Centers</h3>
              <p>
